This project aims to develop a personality inference system based on chat analytics to provide data to infer personality traits from users' chat content in real time. With the development of artificial intelligence and natural language processing technology, online chat data has become a valuable psychological analysis resource. Unlike traditional questionnaire personality tests, personality inference based on chat content can be carried out more naturally and covertly, without requiring users to fill out additional questionnaires. The system will use natural language processing (NLP) technology to analyze sentiment, topic, and language style of the chat text, and extract features that are valuable for personality inference.
Combined with the five personality models (openness, responsibility, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism), the system uses machine learning algorithms (such as support vector machines, deep learning, etc.) for training and inference to realize the evaluation of users' personality tendencies. In addition, the system will also provide real-time emotional feedback based on the results of sentiment analysis to help users understand their own emotional changes and personality characteristics. The system can not only improve the user experience and enhance interactivity, but also provide technical support for application scenarios such as personalized recommendation and user behavior prediction, and has a wide range of practical application prospects.

本项目旨在开发一款基于聊天分析的人格推断系统提供数据，通过实时分析用户的聊天内容推断其人格特征。
随着人工智能和自然语言处理技术的发展，在线聊天数据成为一种宝贵的心理分析资源。
与传统的问卷人格测试不同，基于聊天内容的人格推断能够更自然、更隐蔽地进行，不需要用户额外填写问卷。
系统将利用自然语言处理（NLP）技术对聊天文本进行情感分析、话题识别、语言风格分析等处理，从中提取出对人格推断有价值的特征。\
结合五大人格模型（开放性、责任心、外向性、宜人性、神经质），系统通过机器学习算法（如支持向量机、深度学习等）进行训练和推断，实现对用户个性倾向的评估。
此外，系统还将根据情感分析结果提供实时的情绪反馈，帮助用户了解自身的情绪变化和个性特点。该系统不仅能够提升用户体验，增强互动性，还能够为个性化推荐、用户行为预测等应用场景提供技术支持，具有广泛的实际应用前景。
